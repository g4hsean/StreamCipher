# StreamCipher
One time pad stream cipher using SHA-3 key generation algorithm (uses binary object for IV)

# What is still to do:

1) Save the current state of keygen algorithm so like that there are no key reuses for every successive use of the stream cipher after the initial IV.

2) Analyze the method to ensure there are no cryptanalysis attacks (i.e make sure method used is not poorly implemented)
